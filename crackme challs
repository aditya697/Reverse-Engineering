# ***CRACKME0x00a***

We are given a elf file. By giving it permission and running it we can see that code is recurisve.

We can see there is scanf function by fixing breakpoint at scanf and running we can see ``%s`` which means input is a string.

Then by using gdb and use ```disas main```. We get the code.In that we see a ``strcmp`` function.

By fixing breakpoint at that strcmp and running the program we can see that the string to which it is being compared is ```g00dJ0B!```
